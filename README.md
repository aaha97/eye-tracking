# eye-tracking
Learning how to use OpenCV and eventually eye-tracking as an input option

## Log:
    We started of by installing Anaconda and installing opencv with conda. Then we made this repo and made a commit with this very update

    Next we found a good tutorial by CodingEnterpreneurs on OpenCV and followed it one by one. Next commit comes after learning how to capture webcam feed and showing it on screen.
